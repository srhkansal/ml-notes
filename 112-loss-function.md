**loss function**  
Evaluates how well your algorithm is modelling your dataset.  
  
**Regression problems**  
- MSE
    - Issues when there are ourliers    
- MAE
    - Address ourliers
- Huber
    - use MSE when it is not outlier and MAE when  it is a outlier
 
**Classification problems**    
- Binary cross entropy
    - Output layer needs to use sigmoid as activation function    
- Categorical cross entropy
    - output layers needs to use softmax
