- Accuracy score
  - in machine learning, specifically in classification problems, measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions.  
- Precision Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
  - Minimizing false positives is crucial
  - Example: Spam detection, Fraud detection
- Recall
  -  Recall= True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
  - Minimizing false negatives is crucial
  - Example: Disease diagnosis, Security systems
- F1 score
  -  F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
  - A balance between precision and recall is needed
