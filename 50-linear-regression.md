**Linear Regression**  
- Simple Linear Regression - One input and one output  
- Multiple Linear Regression - Multiple input and one output
- Polynomial Linear Regression - If data is not linear 


**To find (m, b) or (weightage and bias) there are 2 ways**
- closed form solution: Use a mathematical formula to find m and b
- Open form solution:
  - Use approximation techniques like gradient descent, SGD | For high dimesnion this is the solution
