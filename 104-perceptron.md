**Perceptron**  
- perceptron is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks and forms the foundation for more complex neural networks used in machine learning.
- The perceptron is a simple binary classifier that makes predictions based on a weighted sum of inputs.
- It is trained by adjusting weights to reduce prediction errors on labeled data.
- It is limited to linearly separable problems and cannot handle non-linear data without modification (e.g., multi-layer perceptrons).
