**Feature Transformation**  
Modifying or changing the original features (variables) of a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms or to make the data more suitable for analysis.   

- Missing Value Imputation
  1. Eliminate, Mean/Median, Most Frequent
- Handling Categorical Features
  1. Categorical to Numerical conversion | One Hot Encoding
  2. Numerical TO Categorical - Age 0-15 goes in a group
- Outlier Detection
-  Scaling
   - Scaling adjusts the range of numeric features so they fit within a specific scale
   - Scaling required?
   - Mostly standardization is used. Normalization is used when you know min and max of feature value
   - Types
